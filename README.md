## **Feature Engineering Unstructured Data (Audio &amp; Wave Files)**

**Learning Objective:** The purpose of the assignment is to derive feature engineering spectrograms of wave files:

- Display a spectrogram/chromagram/cqt/etc.

- Compute a mel-scaled spectrogram 

- Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). 

- Beat tracker
  
- Compute the constant-Q transform of an audio signal.
